You know how when you were young and foolishly spent money without thinking about the long term consequences?

This calculator will show you how much those small expenses actually cost you if you had spent the money on S&P 500 index funds instead.

The calculations are based on lump sums and do not include dividend reinvestment since that can vary by fund. 

You won't get an exact amount, but you will get a pretty good idea of what that money could have been worth, especially over longer time periods.
